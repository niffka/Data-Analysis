"""
Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
All of the countriesÂ´ GDP has increased during the years. China has recorded biggest increase in GDP, followed by Chile and Zimbabwe.
With that also life expectancy has increased, since both GDP and life expectancy are strongly correlated. 
Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
All correlation values are almost reaching 1, so there is strong correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

What is interesting about this data is fact that even thought USA has multiple times higher GDP than Chile or Germany, 
these two countries have still higher average life expectancies. This shows us that even thought GDP is strongly correlated with life expectancy in each country, 
life expectancy depends more on quality of health system services provided to people and the way of life, healthy habits and healthy lifestyle of these people.
